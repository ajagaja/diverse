The matrix must include proper names for rows and columns. The parameter data, can also be a dataframe with three columns in this order: entities, categories, value of abundance.}

\item{sort}{Indicates if results should be ordered or not. Define it to FALSE to avoid ordering.}

\item{entity_col}{entities are in columns. The analysis assumes that in the data matrix, the entities are in rows, but, if in the data matrix the entities are in the columns and the categories in the rows, then, the parameter entity_col, should be set to TRUE. Default is FALSE}
